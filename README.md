# Malaysian Citizen Preferred Holiday Trip Destination
## Data Science and Data Analysis Project
This project aims to discover the touristâ€™s travel destination using machine-learning
approach, which includes data preparation, analysis, cleaning, transformation, modelling and testing. K-Nearest
Neighbour algorithm was used for the classification model. The dataset was obtained from a Google Form and was
divided into a ratio of 80:20, where 80% are used for training and 20% for testing data. Jupyter Notebook is the
platform used in this project to create the model.
